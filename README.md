Data is everywhere. As a student majoring in business analytics, I have become aware of the growing importance of data in our everyday life and strive to understand how it can be manipulated to benefit us. As part of this journey, I have sought opportunities to learn about statistics, mathematics, and computer science in an attempt to fully grasp the its intricacies and complexities.

On this page, expect to see:
<ul>
  <li>R projects using Tidyverse and similar data-wrangling packages</li>
  <li>Analytical and statistical data analysis projects</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous Python or web development projects</li>
</ul>
